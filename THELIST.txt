                                   THE LIST


This file lists projects that I've actually used after discovering them. The 
reason of having this list is sometimes when someone comments on my videos, 
I've got a feeling that they think I do use them on daily basis.

Of course not possible, I've more than a thousand of videos, there is no way, 
not ever a small portion, that I do use them all.

Nonetheless, I do pick up a few, so here is the list with the dates of first 
uses or video published date, links, and short notes.
