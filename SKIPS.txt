                                  shellfuncs

      Import and execution of shell script functions from Python script

Why would anyone do that? The author of shellfuncs [1] gives three reasons:

- use existing shell scripts in a pythonic way
- complex piping stuff might be easier to implement in shell script
- testing shell scripts is a pain in the a** - with Python it'll be easier

I can't say that those are good reasons when you somehow want to mix Python 
and shell scripts. It's the same as mixing Python with any other languages 
requiring an interpretor.

Anyway, it's still amazing to see that you can do that just because you can do 
that like this:

  import shellfuncs

  from roulettes import russian_roulette

  returncode, stdout, stderr = russian_roulette()

Where `roulettes` actually is a shell script (roulettes.sh) and 
`russian_roulette` is a shell function from the shell script.

            Lightweight curses/Motif spreadsheet based on GNU oleo

NeOleo [1] is a fork of GNU Oleo [2], which was last released in 2001 (Version
1.99.16). The most apparent difference between Oleo and other spreadsheet
programs is the cell references, which are in the format of `R#C#`, clearly short for "Row" and "Column."

[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Oleo

It has different parsing patterns for the cell contents, it's required to
quote the text content seemingly. Oleo is quite unusual to users who are used
to Excel-like spreadsheet. And there seems to be a concept of programming [1]
by the use of cells.

As for NeOleo, its latest version is 3.0.1 (2016-11-29), supporting ncurses
and Motif+Xbae (grid widget) interfaces.
