NeOleo [1] is a fork of GNU Oleo [2], which was last released in 2001 (Version
1.99.16). The most apparent difference between Oleo and other spreadsheet
programs is the cell references, which are in the format of `R#C#`, clearly short for "Row" and "Column."

It has different parsing patterns for the cell contents, it's required to
quote the text content seemingly. Oleo is quite unusual to users who are used
to Excel-like spreadsheet. And there seems to be a concept of programming [1]
by the use of cells.

As for NeOleo, its latest version is 3.0.1 (2016-11-29), supporting ncurses
and Motif+Xbae (grid widget) interfaces.
