Yu-Jie Lin (formerly READYT)

This is a personal channel by a command-line (CLI) lover who wants you to READ on YouTube, so expecting most of videos are recordings of terminal window and information written in description boxes.

My videos are meant for a glance of the subject, they would be:

◈ ≲1 minute long ◈ no music ◈ no audio ◈ straight to the point

If you have anything to share with me, even just drop a link, you can use:
