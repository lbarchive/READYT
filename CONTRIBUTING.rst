Opening an issue
================

What to open
------------

Please do feel free to open an issue for whatever you need, you can:

* suggest programs or projects for me to make a video
* comment about my videos
* ask questions, suggestions, or for specific needs of programs

If I have linked from video description to an GitHub issue, then it might be better you comment on the specific issue which I have already opened for the video. But it's no big deal, don't worry about it even you open another one.


What not to open
----------------

My YouTube channel isn't a Tech Support, so if I feel you are asking as if I am a tech support, I will close the issue right away. It doesn't mean you can't open an issue for your trouble, but in such case, a comment on YouTube Google+ comment might be a little better place to ask.

For any bugs, you should file a bug report on project's tracker, that's the only right way to deal with and help other people.
