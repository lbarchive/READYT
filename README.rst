About me
========

My name is `Yu-Jie Lin`_ and I'm a command-line (CLI) lover, so expecting most of videos are recordings of terminal window, but I do more than that.

About my videos
===============

What to expect
--------------

Mostly short, but not tutorials, almost all without audio tracks, no horrible music, no terribly unnecessary transitioning texts. Go straight to the points of what I want to show you about a program.

There will be description about my thoughts, possibly some short notes about controls or command-line options. My video includes the description, video and description together are the whole video, so be sure to read the description.

In the end of description, links and information about version, programming languages and major dependencies or libraries, the author(s), and the license.


Why do I make videos
--------------------

There were times that I went to a project's web page and couldn't figure out what a program would look like, does it even have UI? If I was lucky, I would at least get a screenshot.

So, quick videos to let you see what you might get are the whole idea.


How long and how many?
----------------------

Many are less than one minute, and I would probably upload two a day or even less. But don't count on that, if there is a reason to have ten, then I will upload that many.


FAQ
===

What's the font?
----------------

It's `Envy Code R`_ Preview #7.2 by Damien Guard.

Why ``READYT``
--------------

Because you need to read the description box of my videos. My video = *video* + *description*.

``READYT`` was former name of my channel, now it's considered as a codename since February, 2016.
